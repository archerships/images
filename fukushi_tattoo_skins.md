I'm actually surprised this isn't done more often, given how many goths there are in the US.

"Dr. Masaichi Fukushi, a pathologist, was interested in the art of Japanese tattooing. Fukushi would remove the tattooed skin off of donated bodies and preserve them and keep them stretched in a glass case. He would also offer to pay for people that couldnâ€™t afford to get their full body tattoos finished on the condition that they would allow him to skin their bodies upon their death and preserve the tattoos. There are 105 skinned items (many of which are full body suits) on display at this museum."
