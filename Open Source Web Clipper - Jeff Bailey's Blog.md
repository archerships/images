# Open Source Web Clipper - Jeff Bailey's Blog
Reading Time: &lt; 1 minute

Open source web clipper?! Yes, it’s true, there [is such a thing](https://clipper.website/), and it’s awesome.

I’ve been using Evernote for a couple years, and I’ve found it be less than ideal. It has many features that I like, but it’s trying to do too many things.

I’ve also used OneNote and Notion and find that they are also trying to do too much. That’s why I appreciate the simplicity of tools like the open source web clipper.

The [Evernote web clipper](https://evernote.com/features/webclipper) is one of my favorite features. When I find an article I really like I clip it. I’ve been burned too many times by bookmarking an article, only to find it was removed. I’m also interested in being able to read articles offline on planes. ✈️

Enter the [open source web clipper extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-clipper/mhfbofiokmppgdliakminbgdgcmbhbac) on Google Chrome. I recently moved my notes to [Dendron](https://jeffbailey.us/blog/2021/01/23/dendron-and-gitjournal/), and I’m now storing my notes in GitHub.

I was pleased to see that the web clipper extension provides a GitHub integration. I’m now able to clip my notes and store them alongside my other notes.

I’ll update this blog post if I find any other notable features.
